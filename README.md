# 7-24-classical-music-bot

My bot for stupid discord badge(It is works now! Just need some improvements but its already really good.)

I recommend to use docker image for running bot if you are not you need ffmpeg and libsodium working properly in target computer.

Also dont forget to define environment variables!(.env file)

Also dont forget to compile typescript code with `npx tsc`!
