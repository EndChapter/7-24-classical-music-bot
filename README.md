# 7-24-classical-music-bot


Hello! This is my little bot for the stupid discord badge. It streams 7/24 classical music on specified channels. You can run your instance with docker or invite my bot with [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1042168668831879229&permissions=2150629376&scope=bot)

If you choose to run your instance, I recommend to use a docker image for this.

For cases that you don't want to use docker, you need FFmpeg and Libsodium working properly on the target computer.

It also needs Python3 too because I am using youtube-dl if it's still not working try to install python.

Don't forget to make `npm install`!

Don't forget to define environment variables! (. env file)

Don't forget to compile typescript code with `npx tsc`!
