# 7-24-classical-music-bot

My bot for stupid discord badge(It is works now! Just need some improvements but its already really good.)

I recommend to use docker image for running bot if you are not you need ffmpeg and libsodium working properly in target computer.

It is also needs python too because I am using youtube-dl if its still not work try to install python.

Dont forget to make `npm install`!

Dont forget to define environment variables!(.env file)

Dont forget to compile typescript code with `npx tsc`!
